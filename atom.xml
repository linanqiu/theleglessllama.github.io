    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>How To Answer</h2>

<p>Thank the person for asking us. After all, no one is asking them to use our service. It also helps us make them feel welcome! Remember, we&rsquo;re trying to build a community base.</p>

<p>Put your answer in brief in your first paragraph or first few lines. That way, people who&rsquo;re lazy to click &lsquo;Continue Reading&rsquo; can still get the gist of what&rsquo;s being written without delving into a potential wall of text.</p>

<p>Illustrate step by step how you arrive at the answer. Remember to signpost your answer – always link what you&rsquo;re saying to the previous step as well as its location in the thought process so people can follow your train of thought!</p>

<p>Be Friendly! Place yourself in the reader&rsquo;s shoes. Use &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;You&rdquo;, and &ldquo;We&rdquo; rather than the passive voice. Also check your tone for unintentional sarcasm &ndash; as a precaution.</p>

<p>Use original content where you can. If you&rsquo;re referring to a source, summarize it rather than just directing the person to the link &ndash; which most of us know creates some sort of nightmare.</p>

<p>If an OL lecture is available that provides the answer, or instruction in that direction, use and prioritize that &ndash; remember to link to it!</p>

<p>If a question skews towards asking for an outright solution, provide less content and more hints. Guide the reader&rsquo;s train of thought and challenge them to think rather than providing them with the exact answer, though we still want them to get some sense of it.</p>

<p>Try to gauge and answer at the level of the reader. If you&rsquo;re going in-depth, provide a simple answer first, then clearly tell the reader that you&rsquo;re getting down and dirty.</p>

<p>Never insert non-essential information that may not aid the reader&rsquo;s understanding of said concept. Knowing that a cat is furrier than other cats doesn&rsquo;t necessarily tell the reader that a cat is a cute pet.</p>

<p>Recall that in OL lectures, we checkpoint the lectures so that it becomes understandable. Same thing here – remember to checkpoint your answers, giving a brief so that readers know what you&rsquo;re writing in a particular paragraph.</p>

<h2>Internal Triaging</h2>

<p>Questions should be triaged internally for the standard of the questions asked in this manner:</p>

<ol>
<li>Serious curriculum/academic work</li>
<li>Questions that ask for pure information</li>
<li>Crazy questions (ultra-high difficulty, think Olympiad level)</li>
<li>General inquiries</li>
<li>Troll questions (lowest priority)</li>
</ol>


<p>This allows us to determine the urgency of the question, as well as the level of response required Use the following spectrum to decide how much of an answer should be given. The more the question skews toward asking for solutions, the less content and more hints should be given.</p>

<h2>Quality Control</h2>

<p>Remember to have these things in mind when you answer questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is it correct?</strong> We need to ensure that the answer is factually accurate! Make sure you know what you are doing when you are answering the question. Wikipedia and Google can be good resources for you to double check your information.</li>
<li><strong>Is the level suitable?</strong> People come here to look for a quick fix, do not spam them with excessive information. The guideline is A levels, however, other concepts that are slightly above A levels can be brought in if it aids the understanding. Things that are beyond A levels should be clearly labelled.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the guidelines for equations!</strong> Right now we are still writing equations in Facebook so before we work out a more elegant way of presenting them, follow the guidelines below.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Formatting</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Basic English.</strong> If a question is poorly phrased when sent in, polish it up for the sake of clarity, and make it look presentable before posting it on the site. You don&rsquo;t see aunt agony/submission columns on established sites posting up questions with broken English.</li>
<li><strong>No Walls of Text.</strong> We&rsquo;re sure you wouldn&rsquo;t want to read a never-ending string of text! Keep it simple and in point form. It works the same way as in the videos &ndash; we want bite-sized info!
Proper, simple, understandable should be the maxim.</li>
<li><strong>Hash-tagging should be done appropriately.</strong> To aid the users in finding our answers, hash tag as such: #OQMath or #OQ<insert subject here>, where first letter of the subject should be capitalized.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Equations</h2>

<p>As a rule of thumb, avoid LaTeX syntax until we get the LaTeX interpreter up. While it does make everything crystal clear, not everyone is familiar with LaTeX. So for now, we do everything linearly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Basic operations</strong>, i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, stick with the common symbols. For multiplication, use &ldquo;x&rdquo; only when there is NO variable x in the question. If there is, switch to the usage of brackets for multiplication (e.g. For 3 times 4x write (3)(4x) instead of 3x4x)</li>
<li><strong>Exponential terms</strong>. &ldquo;^&rdquo; represents power, so a ^ b would be a to the power of b. Keep track of what is in the power term. If the exponential has more than one term use brackets, e.g. a ^ (b+c).</li>
<li><strong>Logarithms</strong>. Any log taken to base 10, express it as lg and when it is base e, express it as ln. Simple. Now for a different base, e.g. log of b taken to base a, write log b (base a). Also, use brackets when you log more than one term.</li>
<li><strong>Fractions</strong>. Usually, they can be represented by the simple divide sign, e.g. a/b. Do take note of what&rsquo;s in the numerator and denominator when typing complicated fractions. For example, (1-x)/y is different from 1 &ndash; x/y – so remember to use brackets when the numerator and/or the denominator has more than one term.</li>
<li><strong>Differentials</strong>. The simple dy/dx approach&hellip; should work. For specifying the differential at points, write it in this form: dy/dx(x=a) = 10</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>. Similarly, the simple &ldquo;int&rdquo; will represent the integration sign. Now to specify boundaries, put the limits in brackets. For example, int(x)[2,3] would mean integrating from 2-3.</li>
<li><strong>Spaces</strong>. Try not the type whole equations out without any spaces, do add the where appropriate &ndash; e.g. cos(kx) = 1 &ndash; 2sin<sup>2</sup>(kx/2)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Posting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ideally, posts should be verified by at least 1 more person before being approved for publication. However, if your answer has remained unverified for more than 3 days, approach someone directly to verify it for you.</li>
<li>Posts should be posted within 7 days of submission.</li>
<li>Posts should be checked for:

<ul>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Clarity and Coherence</li>
<li>Formatting &amp; Language</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publish status: Yes (Y), No (N), and Pending (P) are self-explanatory. When you&rsquo;re done answering a question, remember to assign them in the document so everyone&rsquo;s kept in the loop.</li>
<li>Schedule posts every half hour to an hour, depending on the amount of questions we have to post for the day.</li>
<li>Peak hour(s) are usually from around 6pm-10pm. One post may be scheduled in mid-afternoon if suitable.</li>
<li>Check for posts already scheduled before scheduling more in the Activity Log on Facebook, or we may have overlapping posts!</li>
<li>If the answer is inaccurate/incomplete after posting, edit the post accordingly, and comment with on the post with the page with &lsquo;post amended&rsquo; or something of sorts.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://theleglessllama.github.io/blog/creating-a-new-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re running <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. If the previous sentence, or the links referred to in that sentence looked like Greek to you and you really only want to make one post, we highly recommend you approach someone from AAD, or Linan, or Kenneth, to help you publish your post. This method&rsquo;s been scientifically proven to cause less hair loss.</p>

<p>Really want to learn Greek? Let&rsquo;s get started then. This is a &ldquo;Dummy&rsquo;s Guide&rdquo;, by the way. If you have a degree/major/minor in Computer Science, or are going to get one, it may be easier for you to follow the documentation provided by Octopress themselves in the link above.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Introduction to Octopress</h2>

<p>Octopress is a blogging engine for hackers. It doesn&rsquo;t have a GUI like <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> or <a href="http://blogspot.com/">Blogspot</a> with buttons for you to click and a nice space for you to upload photos and type your post. Everything&rsquo;s done from the command line, and posts are written in a text file. Let&rsquo;s break that down bit by bit.</p>

<p>Octopress is built off a page management system called Jekyll. The reason why we don&rsquo;t set up Jekyll directly is not because we can&rsquo;t but is because Jekyll is one sonovabitch to get working, so we use Octopress.</p>

<p>Octopress runs off Git and <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. Git is version control software. It looks at all your files, compares it to the &ldquo;stock&rdquo; version on a server and shows you the difference between the two, asking what changes you&rsquo;d like to keep and what you&rsquo;d like to throw away. Github is a website that stores all the Git data and makes life easier for people who find using Git from a command line too daunting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important that you understand this before we go any further.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Get Permission</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to be added as a collaborator in the repository in order to post. Create a Github account if you don&rsquo;t already have one, and drop a note to Kenneth or Linan to add you in.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ll say that if the following decision chain matches your current frame of mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;re not good with Tech</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not feeling particularly adventurous and don&rsquo;t feel the immediate need to learn about these things</li>
<li>You just want to make a one-off post
You&rsquo;ll be likely better off passing us your article and letting us do the heavy-lifting for you. No worries there.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Step 2: Cloning Octopress</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by making a copy of Octopress. If you&rsquo;re a command-line addict, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/theleglessllama.github.io.git OEKR
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>OEKR
</span><span class='line'>bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in a directory of your choice.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not, visit our <a href="http://github.com/theleglessllama.github.io">Github Repository</a> and click &ldquo;Clone to Desktop&rdquo;. A dialog box will pop up asking you where you&rsquo;d like to save the files. Both methods are identical.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve already cloned Octopress before and just want to add a new post now, be sure to run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git pull
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>from the Octopress directory. This updates your local copy with the latest copy from the server, if there&rsquo;s been any changes.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Creating a New Post</h2>

<p>From here on you may shy away from the command line no longer. Open Terminal or <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm</a> (we don&rsquo;t really care about Windows, but if it pleases you, open that bloatware called MS-DOS Prompt) and type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rake new_post
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will return a prompt asking for the title of your post. Fill that up accordingly, hit enter, and your post will be created.</p>

<p>Posts in Octopress are created as text files written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (i.e. they have a file extension of either &ldquo;.md&rdquo; or &ldquo;.markdown&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to specify things like lists, headers, quotes and the likes. You can and should learn it at the link above. It was written by the very guy who wrote the language, and it&rsquo;s really quite simple.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Editing Your Post</h2>

<p><em>The astute reader will realize that in the previous step, all we did was create the title of the post, and the post itself, but not the content of the post. Unfortunately brain-scanning technology hasn&rsquo;t yet been invented. We&rsquo;re told that Gary Lee is interested in working on that, but seeing as how he won&rsquo;t get his PhD until seven years later, and his bond won&rsquo;t be finished until six years on top of that, nope, it&rsquo;s not coming anytime soon.</em></p>

<p>The newly created post will be found in <code>source/_posts</code>, and named according to Jekyll&rsquo;s naming conventions. Basically it looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.markdown
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where <code>post-title</code> is a hyphen-delimited version of whatever you specified earlier in the title field. Nothing fanciful, but it does the job.</p>

<p>Open the file, and you&rsquo;ll be greeted by a preamble that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="nn">---</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">layout</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">post</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;Your</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Title&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">date</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">2011-07-03 5:59</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">comments</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">external-url</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">categories</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nn">---</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s really self-explanatory. Let&rsquo;s break that down.</p>

<p>Leave <code>layout</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>external-url</code> unchanged. No hard feelings, but if you know what those do, you won&rsquo;t really be needing this guide.</p>

<p><code>title</code> is whatever you want your title to be. It must be encapsulated in double quotes. Feel free to get creative, but keep it short.</p>

<p><code>comments</code> is a boolean (meaning it can be set to true or false) that enables or disables, well, comments. We won&rsquo;t insult your intelligence telling you what to do with this one.</p>

<p><code>categories</code> is a little more interesting. This allows you to tag your posts so there&rsquo;s some sense of order to them. You can write something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">categories</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Shit Kenneth Says</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>across posts, and it&rsquo;ll get grouped neatly for you in a link in the sidebar. If you want to add multiple categories:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">categories</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">Shit Kenneth Says</span><span class="p-Indicator">,</span> <span class="nv">Shit Linan Says</span><span class="p-Indicator">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">categories</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Shit Kenneth Says</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Shit Linan Says</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will do the job for you. Savvy?</p>

<p>Write your post after the <code>---</code> that signifies the end of the preamble. This can be as long as you&rsquo;d like it to be. Just don&rsquo;t write us the Iliad, or the Odyssey, or 50 Shades of Gray.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Preview Your Post</h2>

<p><em>By now you&rsquo;re thinking that this whole posting thing is like taking off your suspenders, pants and undergarments just so you can fart. Hold on a little longer, and I&rsquo;ll show you why it&rsquo;s worth the trouble.</em></p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve written your post you&rsquo;ll likely want to see how it looks like. We&rsquo;re vain people, we understand.</p>

<p>Go back to the command line and run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rake generate
</span><span class='line'>rake preview
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The terminal window will spit out a bunch of text that seems to be telling you that files are changed (wow!) and that it&rsquo;s going to preview your post for you (double wow!).</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;re done with that, go back to your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>, where you&rsquo;ll see a local version of the blog waiting for you in all it&rsquo;s glory.</p>

<p><em>If you look at Jethro or Kenneth&rsquo;s computers, you&rsquo;ll find that we </em>navigate to an address like <a href="http://octopress.dev">http://octopress.dev</a> instead of the funny localhost and four digit number thing. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re awesome. No really. But if you want to learn to be awesome, here&rsquo;s <a href="">another article</a> on that for you._</p>

<p>Give your post a good look over, and if you&rsquo;re happy with what you see, we&rsquo;ll now move into deploying the post to the actual site.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to make any changes, go ahead and update your content in the <code>.markdown</code> post file. This time, however, because <code>rake preview</code> is already running, you don&rsquo;t need to re-run it. Changes will automagically be detected and applied live in the browser. I know, I know.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Deploying</h2>

<p><em>We&rsquo;d like to personally assure you that this is the most straightforward step in the entire damn tutorial.</em></p>

<p>Go back to the command line, turn off <code>rake preview</code> if it&rsquo;s running (That&rsquo;s <code>Ctrl+C</code> on Windows or <code>CMD+C</code> on OS X if you don&rsquo;t know how). Then type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rake deploy
</span><span class='line'>git add .
</span><span class='line'>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;New Post&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>git push origin <span class="nb">source</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Go for a coffee while the command line window spits out stuff that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you.</p>

<p>Come back, visit <a href="http://theleglessllama.github.io/">http://theleglessllama.github.io/</a> and give yourself a pat on the back. You&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering what we did in that line of text above (boy, your teacher is going to be so proud of you), here&rsquo;s what actually happened.</p>

<p>We first told Octopress to generate a production version of the post you created. This checks it for any errors, tidies up everything, and makes sure the links, images, and stuff like that all work properly.</p>

<p>Next, it takes the new post you&rsquo;ve created and adds it to our live server. This process could take a bit of time depending on how fast your connection is.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, the next three lines tell your computer to update the source files on the back-end of the server with the raw data of the post that you created. This is done so that other people who pull from the repository can make edits to your post if they&rsquo;d like to.</p>

<h2>Why The Hassle?</h2>

<p>At the back of your head there&rsquo;s this nagging concern that this is possibly the most overkill way to create a blogpost ever. If you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case (for some reason), here&rsquo;s a quick workflow to prove our point:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create Post</li>
<li>Edit Preamble</li>
<li>Write Post</li>
<li>Preview</li>
<li>Edit Post</li>
<li>Generate Post</li>
<li>Deploy Post</li>
</ol>


<p>This process allows us to have incredibly granular control over the posting process. With the exception of (7), everything else doesn&rsquo;t require the Internet. You could be in the middle of the Nevada Desert happily writing a post &ndash; or many posts &ndash; and only push everything back onto the server once you felt like it (or you returned to civilization).</p>

<p>In addition, multiple people can all be writing posts at the same time on their own computers, and we wouldn&rsquo;t get confused at all. We&rsquo;d know who wrote exactly what, who changed what, and who&rsquo;s posting what. At any time if we&rsquo;re not comfortable with something, we can quickly roll-back to a previous version, and it&rsquo;ll all be seamless.</p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still having difficulty, check out the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">documentation from Octopress themselves</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to think that we described it in a manner that&rsquo;s hopefully a bit more friendly for beginners, but well, we didn&rsquo;t write the book &ndash; they did. So there.</p>
